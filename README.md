# GradebookDBProject

All of our files were run in MySQLWorkBench.

To run them, simply:

1. Download MySQL & MySQLWorkbench
2. Copy & Paste the code from the file
3. Click the lightning bolt to run

The "Task2CreateGradebook" file MUST be run FIRST BEFORE any of the other files in order to ensure correct computations.
